## Profile

I am a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience, focusing on solving complex technical problems. As a language polyglot, I am particularly skilled in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and C#. I am also passionate about functional programming, with hands-on experience in Erlang and Clojure. I strongly believe in open-source development and the spirit of community collaboration.

Since 2018, I have successfully worked remotely, honing my communication and self-management skills, and adapting well to various work environments. In the past three years, I have been instrumental in making critical decisions about software architecture and enhancing system performance.

My work spans several fields, including Web3, security, telecom, and banking, providing me with a broad industry perspective and a diverse skill set.

I thrive on tackling challenging problems and devising intelligent, effective solutions. I am always eager to learn more and grow. I am excited about opportunities where I can apply my technical and leadership skills in environments that value innovation and forward-thinking.
