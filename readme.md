### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Paul

I am a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience, particularly skilled in web development. Besides web, I'm very interested in learning and using different programming languages. In fact, throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of them, including JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, C, C++, F#, Clojure, Java, Erlang, Rust, Scala, and SQL.

I am an admirer of Rich Hickey and find [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5QF2HjHLSE) [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKtk3HCgTa8) [insightful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug) and [interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM) [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) incredibly enlightening.

In my free time, I love working on home automation and DIY projects. I also enjoy riding and customizing Electric Unicycles (EUCs). They're not just a fun hobby for me, but also how I usually get around.

Here are some major open-source contributions I'm proud of:
